                  <strong>User-Centric Architecture:</strong> All data is organized around users and their collections. 
                  Each user can own one collection (or multiple for admins), and all watches, entries, and preferences 
                  are scoped to specific users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Relational Structure:</strong> Watches connect to wear entries, which can optionally link 
                  to trips, events, and water usage activities. This allows for rich querying and analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Row-Level Security (RLS):</strong> Every table has RLS policies ensuring users can only 
                  access their own data, with admin exceptions for support and management.
                </p>

                  <strong>Authentication:</strong> Uses Supabase Auth with email/password authentication. 
                  All sessions are managed securely with JWT tokens.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Authorization:</strong> Role-based access control with two roles: admin and user. 
                  Roles are stored in a separate table to prevent privilege escalation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Data Protection:</strong> All database tables use RLS policies. Admin functions 
                  use SECURITY DEFINER with restricted search paths to prevent SQL injection.

                <p>
                  <strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> AI features are rate-limited to 4 uses per feature per month 
                  for regular users. Admins have unlimited access.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> All AI feature usage is logged for monitoring and analysis.

                <p>
                  <strong>Features:</strong> Collection analysis, watch suggestions, sentiment analysis, 
                  metadata extraction, and price fetching.

                <p>
                  <strong>Fuzzy Matching:</strong> When a watch is marked for trade, the system uses fuzzy 
                  matching to find wishlist items with similar brand and model names.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Location Filtering:</strong> Users can set trade match scope (global, same country, 
                  same state, same city) to filter matches by location.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Trigger-Based:</strong> Matching runs automatically via database triggers when 
                  a watch's trade availability changes.

                  <strong>Daily Tracking:</strong> Each wear entry represents a single day of wearing a watch. 
                  Entries can span multiple days if specified.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Context Association:</strong> Wear entries can be linked to trips, events, or water 
                  activities to provide context and enable filtered analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Aggregations:</strong> The dashboard provides monthly and yearly aggregations, 
                  cost-per-wear calculations, and trend analysis.
