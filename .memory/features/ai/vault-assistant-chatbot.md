'My Vault Assistant' (formerly 'My Vault Pal') is an AI chatbot that acts as a collection expert by analyzing up to 1,000 wear entries and full collection specs. It features persistent, searchable chat history with mobile swipe-to-delete (including haptic feedback) and always-visible desktop management buttons. The interface includes the 'Collection Insights' header (moved from Dashboard) with an expand/collapse toggle and an auto-refresh mechanism that triggers a 2-second debounced re-analysis whenever items are added or modified. Message bubbles support expand/collapse for long AI responses and use session access tokens for secure edge function communication.
