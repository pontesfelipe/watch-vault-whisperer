# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

The platform allows you to manage multiple types of collections in one place. Currently supported collection types are:
- ⌚ **Watches** - Luxury and everyday timepieces
- 👟 **Sneakers** - Athletic shoes and collectible kicks

Each collection type has specialized features and fields tailored to that category.

The platform offers both free and premium tiers:
- **Free**: Unlimited collections, up to 50 items per collection, basic features
- **Premium**: Unlimited items, advanced analytics, priority support, API access
- **Enterprise**: Custom solutions for businesses and serious collectors

### Can I have multiple collections?

Yes! You can create as many collections as you want. For example:

- "Sneaker Rotation" (sneakers)
- "Designer Purses" (purses)

Each collection is completely separate with its own items, stats, and settings.

## Tracking & Statistics

### What is "cost per wear"?

Cost per wear = Purchase cost ÷ Total days worn

This metric helps you understand the value of an item. Examples:
- $5,000 watch worn 500 days = $10/wear
- $200 sneakers worn 20 days = $10/wear

Lower cost per wear = better value from your purchase.

### How are "most worn" items calculated?

Based on total days logged in wear entries. If you wear a watch for 2 days on a trip, that counts as 2 days toward the total.

### Can I track items I don't own yet?

Yes! Use the **Wishlist** feature:
1. Go to Wishlist tab
2. Add items you want to acquire
3. Track brand, model, target price
4. Get notified of trade matches with friends

### Do trips and events work differently per collection type?

They work the same way across all types:
1. Create a trip or event
2. Link items you brought/wore
3. Specify days per item
4. Add notes and photos

This helps track which items go with you on adventures!

### Can I hide purchase prices?

Yes! In collection privacy settings:
